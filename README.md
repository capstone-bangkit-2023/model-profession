# Profession Model
This profession model serves to predict the user's profession based on grades in subjects at the high school level. This model uses tensorflow with supervised learning method. This model receives input in the form of grades from students such as physics, chemistry, biology, Indonesian language, English, and others. Then the input is processed by a model that has several layers and neurons. The output of this model is to produce relevant profession labels or profession names.

# Dataset
In the profession model, we created our own dataset which is a dataset of professions with high school subject grades. This dataset contains thirty-seven professions as labels and fifteen high school subject grades as variables and each label has fifteen observations. We assumed that each profession has a high score in a specific subject so in creating the dataset we made the score in that specific subject high and the other subjects have scores in the range we set.
